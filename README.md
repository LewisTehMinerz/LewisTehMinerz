<h1><img align="left" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/552927506957729802.gif" width="40">Hi, I'm Lewis.</h1>

I'm a variety developer that dabbles in multiple fields such as web, desktop (Windows), Discord, front, and back end development. Not that I'm good at a couple of those, mind you, but I try. My main fields are Discord, back end, and Windows desktop apps. I normally use TypeScript for the first two and C# for the last one, however I'm experimenting with other languages too. I mainly do volunteer work and I don't ask for payment. I use a variety of languages (as you can see by my stats below, surprisingly I use Java the most.. huh).

- âš¡ Fun fact: The Karl-GerÃ¤t (literally Karl-device in German) was a World War II self propelled siege mortar. It took 60cm (24") diameter shells weighing 2,170kg and it's lightest shell was still 1,250kg. The gun had to have a crane, a two-piece heavy transport set of railcars, and several modified tanks to carry shells.
